#Working with Conditional logic (True/False)

print(5==4)  #When you test a check for equality/equal to, "==" sign is used 
#when you run the above query, the result will be "False" as 5 is not equal to 4


print(5!=4)  #When you test a check for non equality/not equal to, "!=" sign is used
#when you run the above query, the result will be "True" as 5 is not equal to 4
